"""Replay recorded sessions through the hook and show where it fires.

Each corpus file is one session: a JSON header line, then hook events in order.
The header names the event where the real pattern derailed (`derails_at`, 0-based
index into the events). The claim under test is narrow and mechanical:

    the hook fires at or before the derailing event, and its decision at that
    moment would have denied the call (or blocked the stop) with a stated reason.

This is not a behaviour experiment. It proves the trigger, not the outcome: a
live agent receiving the denial may still find another path. What it makes
reproducible is that the moment the corpus went wrong is a moment this hook
speaks, and what it would have said.

Sessions with `"expect": "none"` are controls: the hook must stay silent for
every event. Sessions with `"expect": "recovery"` additionally require that the
same call, made again after the guard, passes — denial is a repricing, not a
prohibition.

Run from the repository root:

    python3 eval/replay.py

Exit 0 iff every session meets its expectation. Python standard library only.
