"""Fence locally vendored contracts without reading any other repository.

These copies are correct duplication, not an oversight: each plugin installs alone and none
inherits the others' coverage, so extracting a shared module would break the independence the
marketplace advertises.  What correct duplication cannot survive is silent drift -- if one copy
of `is_cert_none` stops matching, that plugin quietly stops catching a TLS bypass the other
still catches, and nothing says so.

Every vendored symbol therefore pins a digest, and this suite recomputes it.  Three properties
the digest must have, each learned from a case that was watched failing:

* A reworded docstring is not drift.  The copies already differ in their docstrings and are
  correct, so the digest strips the leading docstring; treating prose as drift would make the
  fence noise, and a noisy fence gets deleted.
* A changed constant IS drift, and it touches no function body.  `jwt_decode_callee_chain`
  merely *references* `JWT_CALLEE_RX`; dropping `pyjwt` from that regex blinds this plugin to a
  library the owner still catches while every function body stays byte-identical.  Digesting
  bodies alone let that through -- measured, not supposed -- so a row may name a module-level
  constant, and every in-repository constant a fenced body reads must itself carry a row.
* A symbol that has vanished is drift, not a pass.  An absent symbol fails; it never silently
  digests nothing.

The limit, stated rather than papered over: a repository may not read another repository's
tree, so this fence compares each copy against its own pinned digest, never against the owner's
live source.  It reports "this copy changed since it was last reconciled" and requires a human
to re-pin deliberately.  It cannot report "these two copies now disagree".  Cross-repository
comparison would need one engine reading every tree, which the estate has ruled against.
Functions a fenced body calls are also outside the digest: they are visible in the body and
carry their own tests, whereas a constant's value is invisible at the call site.
